### 1. This is what you did to me. Thank you.
Thank you for teaching me how to speak. And then asking me to be silent when I did speak.

 Were it not for this, all I would do is speak until I had nothing left to say and nobody left to listen to me. I would get lost in myself and there is no wilderness more dangerous to get lost in. You told me reading was the only thing worth doing. It bears the fingerprint of an act of God: each book, every written word and the ideas it carries, is a small miracle. Thank you for showing me this miracle. And it’s curse.



### 2. Thank you for telling me when to be silent and when to speak.
For in my silence, I found my own voice and in listening to yours, I learnt how to form my words.


I learnt too that not all words are beautiful, and not all words must be spoken. That others are destructive, and that sometimes, some things are better left unsaid.



### 3. Thank you for your strict reprimands. I was wrong.
5 years old, I learnt that sometimes I am wrong. And that people are always wrong. And that life isn’t fair. And that it owes me nothing. And that I owe everyone everything but myself.



### 4. Thank you for humiliating me in front of my entire class and friends.
In this, I learnt that people wear masks, and you taught me how to choose my own. The black and velvet poker face for my peers, and a colourful smile for my teachers and the grown-ups. You taught me to wear my emotions like clothes, at a whim, and sometimes with truth. But always like a shirt a size too big or too small in some parts. Like an ill-fitting dress. I wear it even now. Especially when I am alone.



### 5. Thank you for teaching me about my own body as though I could not know.

You and all the boys and girls taught me what body could be beautiful. And that mine could not. And because of your stares at my thin arms, at my uneven chest, I forgot how to be comfortable with my own nakedness. 
Thank you for all these lessons and more. You taught me that in such a cold world, it’s always best to go out dressed. That in a world filled with so much noise, it’s sometimes best to be quiet.


Surrounded by so much ignorance, knowledge is our only hope. Knowledge of our world, but especially knowledge of ourselves.
