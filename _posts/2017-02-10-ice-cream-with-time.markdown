In the heat of the summer sun in Zimbabwe, ice cream is a delightful thing to taste. It's a wonderful thing to look at. Like ambrosia- the food of the Gods. It's the taste of heaven. Only while the weather is hot. Once it turns cold, we fancy hot chocolate. We fancy the warmth. That is the nature of man, that his desires change on a whim, and he is slave to them.

We pay the price for these things- our desires with money, obviously right? Afterall, money is the price of comfort and it can buy anything. It is the price of luxury, and chocolate and flowers. Correct? No.

We don't pay for our iphones and our unnecessarily thick blankets and our big empty homes with our wallets. We don't pay for our big Borrowdale brooke mansions and our too-fast cars with our credit cards. We pay for them with our time. We spend all our lives reaching for something "more." We spend our entire lifetimes searching for something that we couldn't recognise even if we had it, and so many times, we do. So many times we have what we are looking for. But, We are always reaching, always walking faster, farther, to reach the other side where the grass is greener. It is greener, Perhaps. But all grass is green. Just many different shades. And all grass needs to be watered when it doesn't rain. But if we spend our entire lives skipping the fence from here to there, and neglect to water it, then grass is left neither here nor there. Do you remember your Grade 1 teacher saying not to walk on the grass? She was wise. Mine taught me to water it. Especially when I "forgot," to do my homework.

She told me a story once. While I watered the lawn outside our classroom. It was about how man was built with a great hole in his heart, and left to his own devices, he would devour the clouds, the sky and the stars in search of what he didn't know lay within him. Happiness. She said he couldn't be blamed. That happiness was the only thing that mattered- and without knowing it, we sought it in everything except itself. We sought happiness in things, and not in life itself. So of course we never really found it. We spend our entire lives behind desks doing things that make us so unhappy because we want to be happy. I think that is sad.

The nature of society requires that we do unpleasant things to make a living. But it does not require that we waste our entire lives trying to build imaginary ones. It's okay to go to work so you can gain the means to buy ice cream when it's hot and so you can cover yourself with a blanket when it turns cold. Far be it from me to criticize ice cream and the means by which it is obtained- ice cream is the one thing mankind got right. But I do think it incredibly important to take time out of our work and hustle to develop our relationships with our families. With our friends. With everything around us. And with ourselves. To live our actual lives. After all, what is life if not our relationships and ice cream?

I will write my next post talking about how I am fairing with the former and using it to make my life, and my micro-world better. For now, I stand up to go and sit with my parents, and eat some ice cream.

I thank you whoever invented ice cream, you redeem our species.
