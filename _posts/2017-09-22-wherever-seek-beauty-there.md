## Wherever you are, seek beauty there.<br>

Find it in yourself and in everyone else.<br>
Take it into your heart, and keep it there.<br>
and in the cold despair that touches you when you fail.<br>
may you learn to keep yourself warm.
And to mend what is broken, and stitch up what is torn.<br>
Seek beauty in your happiness,<br>
and in your suffering too.<br>
The suffering touches your skin: it cannot touch you.<br>
<br>
<br>

>Seek beauty in silence.<br>

seek it in the constant noise.<br>
In the falling of the rain, pause to smell it. Get wet.<br>
and when the soft snow turns to ice,<br>
and as its soft beauty begins to fade,<br>
Count it joy, that you beheld such beauty in the first place<br>
As you go about your day, and meet people along your way,<br>
Pause and say to someone, I see you..<br>
Seek beauty in a strangers' smiling eyes.<br>
Carry it in your own smile. Smile with your eyes.<br>
<br>
<br>
>Seek beauty in silent tears shed in the dark.<br>

Give it to someone else with a "hi." or a wave in the park<br>
But maybe or maybe not in the dark.<br>
Carry your spark. Carry your light in your heart.<br>
Find beauty between the flowers' petals.<br>
Between your ribs when they are beaten broken.<br>
Find it in your weeping. May it help you find healing.<br>
Find it in your heartbeat,<br>
find it in your healing ribs,<br>
As your wounds turn to scars.<br>
<br>
<br>
>As you fall in and out of love, do not regret it.<br>

Pain will remind you that you are still alive,<br>
and the jokes and laughter your loved ones will bring<br>
 will remind you that it is all of it, worth it.<br>
Find everything you seek, and be willing to give it away<br>
As you seek your happiness, and as you find sadness instead<br>
Do not hold onto either too long.<br>
Remember they do not belong to you:<br>
Let them go, let them go.<br>
Visit your memories in the morning,
and visit your dreams at night.<br>
When you leave them at dawn and at dusk, be reminded you are alive.<br>
Life forgets itself while we have it. Pray, please do not forget it.<br>
may you find it in the beauty of the stars,<br>
and may life make a home in your heart.
May you find it there, and in everything.<br>
<br>
