Do you ever look out your window at the night sky and feel a yearning to be elsewhere? A deep need to be somewhere else- somewhere you've never been. Do you ever look at the stars and watching them twinkle in the darkness of eternity, wonder what is out there in the vastness of space? What lies beyond what our eyes can see?

Let me answer your question.

>Possibility.

In 50,000 years, we have gone from walking and shouting messages to each other to flying, and sending enormous amounts of data at blinding speeds over vast distances. We have gone from smoke signals to fiber optics in 50,000 years. Barely a second in a day in the universe. Our species is defined by our tenacity- our ambition- our innovation.

President JFK summed it up perfectly in his now famous speech at Rice University:

"We choose to go to the moon. We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win, and the others, too."

We invented tools to make our lives easier. The wheel, the hoe, knives, to move heavy loads, to till our land and to cut easier. After this, invention became a means to increase our capacity- to do things we hadn't been able to before- and to those we already did- better. The former I believe is a journey we've only begun to embark on in the last few centuries. All along, it has been optimisation.


I argue that the true mark of intelligence is the generation of ideas for which there is no existing reason, and the development of words, language and terminologies to perpetuate these ideas and better understand them. The creation of new technologies for the sake of it. The reason mankind goes to space- to conquer the next great frontier- our strive to develop artificial intelligence and to reach more and more for concepts like transcendence and the singularity- that is what defines us. Our intelligence inherently wants to discover knowledge and understanding. This age of space travel and technology may be our species next great renaissance- one with impact beyond any other significant events in human history. Look on. Walk on.
