"Is there anything else to see?"
 The afternoon was hot and the air was dry. I wanted water to drink. A watermelon to quench my thirst. I was silent. Annoyed.
"Do you see the sun?" he asked me again.

 "This sun whose heat annoys so, it is why the flowers you so love are in bloom. It is the one and only reason they are open now and sharing their color and beauty with you. They do not love you- they love the sun and they bloom for it- and because they do and bloom for you too- they love you too."
