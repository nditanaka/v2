Undergraduate Network for Research in the Humanities is an organization working to address the lack of cross-institutional support for undergraduate research in the humanities.

To reverse this culture, the Undergraduate Network for Research in the Humanities has become that collective of students from a wide array of colleges and universities whose mission is to promote, present, and encourage rigorous student research in the humanities, especially with an emphasis on digital humanities.

UNRH provides both a physical space for student interactions in the form of an annual conference, and a virtual space on their website with a forum built for the exchange of ideas.

The UNRH network has been steadily growing; in fact, since the first UNRH conference in November, 2015, the conference has accepted over 50 projects, involving over 80 undergraduates from 31 institutions all across the United States, Canada, Nigeria, and Pakistan.

The 2018 conference was hosted by Hope College this past weekend on February 16th-18th in Holland, MI. I was privileged to attend with my professor [Jacob Heil](http://jacobheil.github.io/) who was the key note speaker at this year's conference.

The biggest themes from the conference I feel were around finding support structures and avenues through which to ask humanities and digital humanities questions. Delegates discussed the importance of faculty and student cooperating in the pursuit of research questions.

I was particularly by [Shaheera Pesnani](https://twitter.com/ShaheeraPesnani) insistence on the importance of design thinking centered courses, projects and planning. Many of the delegates expressed the sentiment that access to faculty mentorship and guidance in digital humanities work would move projects forward in incredible ways. There was also mention of departmental tables/ lunches to foster student-faculty conversation by [Arianna Montero-Colbert](https://twitter.com/ariannamc18). These are incredible people, and they are working on the most incredible projects! I want to examine each of their projects individually but find a short description of each of their projects below:
