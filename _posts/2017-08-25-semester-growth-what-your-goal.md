# Class of 2021, the future begins now, and it is ours.

High school is done. With it, childhood is for the most part, done too. Exciting!

>“When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. But when I grew up, I put away childish things.”
>-1 Corinthians 13:11

My meditations on the above words are that as college begins, I am expected to grow and put away the things of my youth now. Simultaneously, I am expected to grow exponentially. In essence, from zero to hundred in an incredibly short time. These are my best years. These shall be your best years too. Live them with enthusiasm. These shall be my worst years too, perhaps. But even then, they shall be our worst years, in the best ways. Live them with enthusiasm, especially because of this.

### Class of 2021, the future begins now, and it is ours.

Our generation is berated for being lazy. And we probably are. Is that not our strength? The reason we create apps, and technology to make our lives better, and to solve problems that up until now were accepted as “part of life.” We are the selfie generation too, and the Despacito generation. That is unfortunate, but it is alright. We get a free pass or two. Or three. Or four.

With the technologies and knowledge we have access to today, we have the ability to build things that will shape tomorrow and fix today. We must set goals for ourselves- high aspirations to do mighty things. To tame outer space and eradicate disease, to eliminate poverty, and create meaning. We must aspire to be more human too, at a time when our humanity is easy to cast aside. We must wear empathy in our hearts and embrace the weaker man. Open your heart to your friend and your foe alike. They are both your friend. Protect them and offer them help.

Help strangers. They can help you in turn, in ways you cannot even expect.
My goal this semester is to grow. In one small way, every single day.

>What are your biggest goals for the next 4 months?

1.To branch out of my peer group every week, and maintain a relationship with someone familiar.
<br>
2.To write an article, (one better than this one I hope) every week.
<br>
3.To read one chapter every week, of that book I never find time for.
<br>
4.To give more than I take. In every possible way. To give my time.
Nothing you can give is as important or as valuable as your time.
<br>
I hope to build something meaningful, and to bring thoughtfulness and love to my relationships.
“If you don’t live in the moment, where do you live? If you don’t fix the future, where will you live tomorrow?”

-class of 2021, this is our challenge. To live in the present, with our eyes on the future.

Please share them with me below. Perhaps we can help each other do amazing things.
