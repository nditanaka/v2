According to The [Economist](https://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21721656-data-economy-demands-new-approach-antitrust-rules-worlds-most-valuable-resource), in 2017, data is the new oil.

With that as a background, I ask you to think about these important questions and the statistics that drive them:

Who do you trust with your data?
<div class="atlas-chart" data-id="Hy2MrdbjZ" data-width="640" data-height="449"><img src="https://www.theatlas.com/i/atlas_Hy2MrdbjZ.png" style="max-width: 100%;"></div><script src="https://www.theatlas.com/javascripts/atlas.js"></script>

In a world where Algorithms, Deep learning, Machine learning, Artificial Intelligence and Convulational Neural Networks control and influence so much of our lives and the underlying infrastructure that allows us to live from day to day, should this technology be regulated?

<div class="atlas-chart" data-id="Skpf4zQjZ" data-width="640" data-height="449"><img src="https://www.theatlas.com/i/atlas_Skpf4zQjZ.png" style="max-width: 100%;"></div><script src="https://www.theatlas.com/javascripts/atlas.js"></script>

In an era where immigration is such a pertinent issue; at a time when "immigrant," is such a controversial word loaded with emotion, the question of the relationship between immigration and innovation is an important one.

How important a role do immigrants play in technological innovation?

<div class="atlas-chart" data-id="VJHNnKBsl" data-width="640" data-height="409"><img src="https://www.theatlas.com/i/atlas_VJHNnKBsl.png" style="max-width: 100%;"></div><script src="https://www.theatlas.com/javascripts/atlas.js"></script>

In 2017, how much of global internet traffic is mobile? With the move towards responsive and mobile first design, what proportion of internet traffic is mobile?

<div class="atlas-chart" data-id="r1_1ZFE0W" data-width="640" data-height="449"><img src="https://www.theatlas.com/i/atlas_r1_1ZFE0W.png" style="max-width: 100%;"></div><script src="https://www.theatlas.com/javascripts/atlas.js"></script>

In 2017, as the world becomes increasingly connected, how long does it take to transmit and download data? What is the time cost of connectivity across the world?

<div class="atlas-chart" data-id="Sk9USJyu-" data-width="640" data-height="449"><img src="https://www.theatlas.com/i/atlas_Sk9USJyu-.png" style="max-width: 100%;"></div><script src="https://www.theatlas.com/javascripts/atlas.js"></script>

As the internet becomes more and more ubiquitous, how many people across the world can no longer imagine life without the internet? This question in many ways indicates our reliance on this technology and on the connections and networks it powers.

<div class="atlas-chart" data-id="HJbuK9kcZ" data-width="640" data-height="449"><img src="https://www.theatlas.com/i/atlas_HJbuK9kcZ.png" style="max-width: 100%;"></div><script src="https://www.theatlas.com/javascripts/atlas.js"></script>

How much does it cost the averge person to access the internet across the world? Is it really affordable then if it costs you 18% of your household income, for just 1 gigabyte?

<div class="atlas-chart" data-id="r1RnrHdYe" data-width="640" data-height="449"><img src="https://www.theatlas.com/i/atlas_r1RnrHdYe.png" style="max-width: 100%;"></div><script src="https://www.theatlas.com/javascripts/atlas.js"></script>

What percentage of the world's population is connected to the "world wide web"?

<div class="atlas-chart" data-id="HyOldtfug" data-width="640" data-height="449"><img src="https://www.theatlas.com/i/atlas_HyOldtfug.png" style="max-width: 100%;"></div><script src="https://www.theatlas.com/javascripts/atlas.js"></script>

More than half of the world still does not have internet access. This is the state of connectivity today. The World Wide Web is not very worldwide.

<div class="atlas-chart" data-id="rytTwmB8x" data-width="640" data-height="449"><img src="https://www.theatlas.com/i/atlas_rytTwmB8x.png" style="max-width: 100%;"></div><script src="https://www.theatlas.com/javascripts/atlas.js"></script>

Given these questions, and information, it is possible to identify a relationship between all of this seemingly disparate information. What is the future of world connectivity? What is the future of global connectivity? What role will access to information play in education, in the development of democracies, and the global economy?
