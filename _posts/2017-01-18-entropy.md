**Entropy**- (n) lack of order or predictability; gradual decline into disorder.

One of the most fundamental laws of physics, the second law of thermodynamics, or the law of entropy basically states that the general tendency of the universe is to move from order and structure to lack of order, lack of structure.

> Most of us know this as "From Order to Chaos" -  CHAO AB ORDO in latin.

 David Christian- [The history of our world in 18 minutes](https://www.ted.com/talks/david_christian_big_history/transcript?language=en) gave a truly fascinating TED talk on this by that title. In it, he examines the entire lifetime of the universe condensing it down to 18 minutes. He talks about Collective learning and Threshholds that have enabled life to develop, citing

> 1: The big bang- the universe appears.
 >2: Stars form and die, fusing protons to create new elements.
 >3: Planets are formed
 >4: Organic life is formed
 >5: Mankind- the 5th threshold.

David Christian cites mankind as the 5th threshold- our advent as being so significant because of what makes us human. In this minute in history, 7 billion minds are learning- and unlike any other species before us, we learn collectively and at light-speed speeds. More importantly, our minds, as well as our DNA is learning and we are able to pass down our knowledge from generation to generation. That is what is truly remarkable. We are learning to modify our own DNA. To alter the conditions of our planet- I would have hoped it be for the better- but alas, we are changing our planet- the conditions through which we came to be and altering them by our activities- unlike any precursor species.

----------

Taking a different path than he did, I ask you to consider this: In a universe governed by this law- Chaos to order- and one in which we came out of chaos, and we are constantly learning to survive, constantly playing unwittingly, willingly or unwillingly in a cosmic game of survival of the fittest- do our activities help us? Do we help our own odds of surviving? Emerging victor? And what will victory look like after we have destroyed or reshaped the very field on which the game was invented. I think we will have to learn to play different game with a different set of rules.
