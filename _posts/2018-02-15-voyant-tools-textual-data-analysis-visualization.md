[Voyant Tools](http://voyant-tools.org/) is one of my favorite text analysis tools because it is fast and easy to use, even for people who have no background in text analysis. Although Voyant offers a lot of options—which can be overwhelming—the interface presents basic results that any user can easily customize. The results of Voyant’s analysis can be downloaded as visualizations or in tab-separated or JSON data formats, and Voyant also generates embed codes for its tools (which I’m using for this blog post), as well as citations for specific analyses. This post will cover basic Voyant functions, including inputting texts for analysis, working with and understanding basic Voyant tools, and downloading data.

Voyant’s tagline is “see through your text.” Computer-based text analysis is a helpful supplement to close reading: for example, it can provide quantitative confirmation of patterns that you notice in a text, allow you to quickly locate interesting words or phrases within a large corpus, and help to contextualize trends in word usage. Using a tool like Voyant at the beginning of a project may also help you to find interesting trends in a text that you’d like to research further.

Voyant accepts texts in a number of ways. You can paste text or URLs (including URLs to PDFs posted online) directly, or you can upload files you have on your computer. These can be plain text, MS Word, or PDF files. You can upload one file to analyze or multiple files as a corpus. For this blog post, I’m using one of Voyant’s built-in test corpuses—the novels of Jane Austen.

The basic interface includes five panes: Cirrus, Reader, Trends, Summary, and Contexts. Each pane is interactive, and selections made in one pane may affect the display of another pane. Below you’ll see an embedded version of each tool; for full functionality, click on the image to open this Voyant corpus in your browser.

The Cirrus tool is a familiar word cloud; hover over each word to reveal the count in the corpus. If you click on a word in the word cloud, the other panes will change to feature that word. Use the scale at the bottom of the tool to limit the word cloud to only specific texts in your corpus. Click on the question mark in the upper right corner for help, and hover just left of the question mark for options for embedding or downloading an image of your results.
