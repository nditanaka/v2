### Here are some interesting charts on the present and future of Africa and the world in data.

With an additional 1.3 billion people on the continent by 2050, Africa will account for the highest population growth spurts compared to other continents.

HappyDB, a dataset resulting from a mechanical turk, procured 50,000 responses through a Mechanical Turk asking people what had made them the most happy in the past three months. Most of the responses had to do with other people and pets. Interestingly, pets don't make people as happy day to day.

Africa's predicted population growth spurt will occur despite expected reductions in fertility rates from 4.7 births per woman between 2010 and 2015 to 3.1 births per woman between 2045 and 2050. The continued growth despite the drop in fertility rates, is down to the "age structure" of the population with as Africa is home to a bulk of the world's youngest countries.
